                To stay focused means to simply persist with the task at hand. To continue to work towards whatever it is that you need to do and ensure that you stay concentrated on that one activity. It isn't multitasking. It isn't daydreaming. It's focusing in on the task at hand and putting in the work to get it done.

            <h2>Develop <br>without Limits</h2>
            <p>
                Its been common sentence that "Practice makes a man parfect". Based on those word there is no boundry for Practice. To live a foreign life its difficult to do coding 15 or 16 hours in a day. However, I try my best to do programming to build logics as much hours I get. Sometime I forget to get also. I am really enjoying this life. Everybody have right to choose their own life. I fall in love with this life and try to learn as much knowledge as I get form online, university or online whatever I got.

            <p>
                In today's world global communication is very important. By sharing view and information we can help each other. Furthermore, for a developer far communication is more important because in a group work if someone is living another country it doesn't metter. By using github, communication software things are getting more easy and flexiable. Morover, with time it will get more and more advance. I am not out of this boundry. I have a lot of international friend in person or socal media. We share views and help eachother when its nessery
